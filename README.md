# Instructions for testing
1. Download the `template.tpl` file from this repo.
2. Browse to a [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) web container with which you want to test the template.
3. In the container, browse to **Templates** by clicking the respective link in the left-hand side navigation.
4. In the box labelled **Tag Templates**, click the **New** button.
5. In the template editor, click the overflow menu (the three-dot menu in the top right corner), and choose **Import**.
6. Select the `template.tpl` file and click to proceed.
7. Wait for the template to finish importing. Once done, click **Save** and close the editor.

You have now added the Amplitude Analytics tag template to your container. You can proceed to implement Amplitude Analytics tracking by following [the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Eg_AnF_rFG86SUxxtbj8gb14FZnWvVox/view?usp=sharing) and Amplitude's own documentation for JS SDK implementation.
